# Train and deploy Mask R-CNN model using Sagemaker Operator for Kubernetes
AWS recently introduced [Sagemaker Operator for Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-operators-for-kubernetes/) which allows ML teams to integrate Sagemaker capabilities with existing Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Scope
This project provides a set of scripts to build container with Mask-RCNN model, then train and deploy model using Amazon EKS cluster.

We'll use [TensorPack Mask/Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/FasterRCNN) model implementation. Model is trained using [COCO 2017 dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home).

## Prerequisites
1. You need to have AWS account ([reference](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)). It's recommended to create all AWS resource in specific AWS region (e.g. us-west-2 or us-east-2).
2. You need to have EKS cluster with Sagemaker Operator configured ([setup reference](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_operators_for_kubernetes.html#setup-and-operator-deployment))
3. Ensure your AWS account has proper limits. You'll need at least 2 `ml.p3.16xlarge` instances for Mask R-CNN training. It's recommended to have 4 instances. 
4. (recommended) Use Sagemaker managed Jupyter/JupyterLab notebooks. Note, that your Sagemaker notebook needs to have IAM role which is authorized to access EKS cluster, have `eksctl`, and `kubctl` utils configured. See configuration steps on Step #2.
5. Create S3 bucket to store training data and training output ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html)).

## Prepare environment
1. Login to Sagemaker notebook (JupyterLab) and open terminal window.
2. Run `./prepare_s3_bucket.sh <YOUR_S3_BUCKET>`. This will upload training dataset to your S3 bucket. 
3. Run `./build_and_push <YOUR_AWS_REGION>`. This will create Mask R-CNN image with training script and push it to AWS ECR. This operation will take 5-10 minutes to complete. If successful, you should see URI of your image. You'll need it later.

## Training Mask R-CNN model
1. Update `train.yaml` as follows:
- (optionally) update "name" field with unique value. This will be a name of your Sagemaker training job;
- update "trainingImage" with URI of your container image (Prepare your envrionment - Step #3);
- update "roleArn" with your Sagemaker execution role ([reference]);(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html)
- update "region" with you AWS region;
- update your "S3OutputPath" and "inputDataPath" with your S3 bucket.
2. Run `kubectl apply -f maskrcnn.yaml` in terminal. This will schedule the Sagemaker job.
3. Monitor your job in Sagemaker console or by running `kubectl describe trainingjob`.
